\title{Calculating Squared Drift Parameter}
\usage{
eta(alpha, beta, ntest, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{The desired type I error rate.}

\item{beta}{The desired type II error rate.}

\item{ntest}{The number of tests.}

\item{type}{The type of the alpha-spending function, k = 1 for O'Briend-Fleming's design and k = 2 for Pocock's design.}
}
\value{
The value of the drift parameter.
}
\description{
This function computes the squared drift parameter given the type I and II error rates,
the number of tests, and the alpha-spending function.
The code is revised from the algorithm/code by Lai (2013).
